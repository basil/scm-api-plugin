/**
 * Static convenience methods that help a method or constructor check whether it was invoked
 * correctly (that is, whether its <i>preconditions</i> were met).
 *
 * <p>If the precondition is not met, the {@code Preconditions} method throws an unchecked exception
 * of a specified type, which helps the method in which the exception was thrown communicate that
 * its caller has made a mistake. This allows constructs such as
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public static double sqrt(double value) {
 *   if (value < 0) {
 *     throw new IllegalArgumentException("input is negative: " + value);
 *   }
 *   // calculate square root
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>to be replaced with the more compact
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public static double sqrt(double value) {
 *   checkArgument(value >= 0, "input is negative: %s", value);
 *   // calculate square root
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>so that a hypothetical bad caller of this method, such as:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * void exampleBadCaller() {
 *   double d = sqrt(-1.0);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>would be flagged as having called {@code sqrt()} with an illegal argument.
 *
 * <h3>Performance</h3>
 *
 * <p>Avoid passing message arguments that are expensive to compute; your code will always compute
 * them, even though they usually won't be needed. If you have such arguments, use the conventional
 * if/throw idiom instead.
 *
 * <p>Depending on your message arguments, memory may be allocated for boxing and varargs array
 * creation. However, the methods of this class have a large number of overloads that prevent such
 * allocations in many common cases.
 *
 * <p>The message string is not formatted unless the exception will be thrown, so the cost of the
 * string formatting itself should not be a concern.
 *
 * <p>As with any performance concerns, you should consider profiling your code (in a production
 * environment if possible) before spending a lot of effort on tweaking a particular element.
 *
 * <h3>Other types of preconditions</h3>
 *
 * <p>Not every type of precondition failure is supported by these methods. Continue to throw
 * standard JDK exceptions such as {@link java.util.NoSuchElementException} or {@link
 * UnsupportedOperationException} in the situations they are intended for.
 *
 * <h3>Non-preconditions</h3>
 *
 * <p>It is of course possible to use the methods of this class to check for invalid conditions
 * which are <i>not the caller's fault</i>. Doing so is <b>not recommended</b> because it is
 * misleading to future readers of the code and of stack traces. See <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/ConditionalFailuresExplained">Conditional failures
 * explained</a> in the Guava User Guide for more advice.
 *
 * <h3>More information</h3>
 *
 * <p>See the Guava User Guide on <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/PreconditionsExplained">using {@code
 * Preconditions}</a>.
 *
 * <p>Adapted from Guava 31.0.1. Usage only internal to this plugin. Marked as restricted to prevent
 * any further usages. This should be switched to upstream when it is no longer beta.

  /*
   * All recent hotspots (as of 2009) *really* like to have the natural code
   *
   * if (guardExpression) {
   *    throw new BadException(messageExpression);
   * }
   *
   * refactored so that messageExpression is moved to a separate String-returning method.
   *
   * if (guardExpression) {
   *    throw new BadException(badMsg(...));
   * }
   *
   * The alternative natural refactorings into void or Exception-returning methods are much slower.
   * This is a big deal - we're talking factors of 2-8 in microbenchmarks, not just 10-20%. (This is
   * a hotspot optimizer bug, which should be fixed, but that's a separate, big project).
   *
   * The coding pattern above is heavily used in java.util, e.g. in ArrayList. There is a
   * RangeCheckMicroBenchmark in the JDK that was used to test this.
   *
   * But the methods in this class want to throw different exceptions, depending on the args, so it
   * appears that this pattern is not directly applicable. But we can use the ridiculous, devious
   * trick of throwing an exception in the middle of the construction of another exception. Hotspot
   * is fine with that.
